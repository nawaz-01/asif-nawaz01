## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hey there! I'm **Asif Nawaz**, a Computer Science student at **UCET Hazaribagh**, currently in my first year of B.Tech. 
I’m passionate about technology and strongly inclined toward **full-stack development**, **app development**, and **cloud computing**.  
Despite being early in my journey, I believe in building things from the ground up — learning by breaking, fixing, and improving.

### 💡 What Drives Me

- 🔍 I believe in **clarity over complexity** — readable, elegant code always wins.
- 🚀 I learn best when I’m **building real things** — projects drive my understanding deeper than tutorials.
- ⚡ I thrive in fast-paced environments like **hackathons**, where speed, collaboration, and problem-solving shine.
- ⏰ I live by the mantra **“Discipline beats motivation”** — I show up daily, no matter how small the step.

---

## 📚 My Learning Approach:

> I don’t just “complete tutorials” — I learn by **doing, reflecting, and iterating**.

Here’s how my journey unfolds:

- ✅ **Mastered the Fundamentals**  
  I've built a strong foundation in **Core Java**, **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, and **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** through consistent practice on **GeeksforGeeks**.

- 📘 **Intermediate Skill-Building**  
  I’m confident in **JavaScript**, especially DOM manipulation, ES6+ features, and asynchronous workflows (Promises, async/await, etc.).

- 🔧 **Real-World Backend Development**  
  I’ve developed secure backend services using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **JWT for authentication**, and **MongoDB** for storage. These projects helped me understand middleware, route protection, and folder structuring.

- ⚛️ **Advancing into Frontend Frameworks**  
  I’m currently diving deep into **React.js**, learning about component architecture, state management, and soon transitioning to **Next.js** for server-side rendering and better performance.

## 💻 Tech Stack I Use & Why

I prefer using a **modern, balanced stack** — one that’s simple, scalable, and great for learning.

- **Frontend**:  
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript — the web’s backbone  
  - React.js — powerful for building modular UIs  
  - Next.js (in progress) — for better SEO and performance

- **Programming Languages**:  
  - Java — my go-to for understanding core CS concepts and DSA  
  - JavaScript — for dynamic, full-stack web development

- **Backend**:  
  - Node.js + Express.js — fast, flexible, and efficient  
  - JWT + Bcrypt — for authentication and secure password handling

- **Database**:  
  - MongoDB — NoSQL, scalable, and works seamlessly with my Node backend  
  - Mongoose — for schema modeling and validation

- **Testing & Tools**:  
  - Postman / Thunder Client — API testing and debugging  
  - MongoDB Compass — visual interface for managing DBs

- **Dev Environment**:  
  - Git & GitHub — for version control and collaboration  
  - Notion — for documenting, planning, and staying organized  
  - VS Code — my customizable, productivity-boosting editor

## 🧩 Projects That Shaped Me

> Every project = a new set of lessons, tools, and breakthroughs.

- **🌐 Web Dev Lab**  
  A growing repository of responsive layouts, animations, and UI components.  
  *Learned:* Media queries, Flexbox/Grid layouts, and frontend polish.

- **♨️ Java Practice Series**  
  A set of Java-based mini-projects and algorithms focused on reinforcing OOP and logic building.  
  *Learned:* Class design, error handling, and object interaction.

- **🧠 DSA Tracker (GFG)**  
  A personal GitHub log of DSA problems solved from GeeksforGeeks.  
  *Learned:* Pattern recognition, debugging skills, and algorithmic thinking.

- **🔐 Secure REST API (Private)**  
  A complete backend system with user authentication and protected routes.  
  *Learned:* JWT token management, middleware, secure coding practices.

- **🧪 API Playground (Coming Soon)**  
  A full-stack API-driven application with proper documentation and testing.  
  *Goal:* Showcase a clean, modular, and testable backend setup.
